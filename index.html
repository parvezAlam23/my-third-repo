    <h2>The New York Times</h2>
    <p class="ny">The New York Times (N.Y.T. or N.Y. Times) is an American daily newspaper based in New York City with a worldwide readership.[7][8] Founded in 1851, the Times has since won 132 Pulitzer Prizes (the most of any newspaper),[9] and has long been regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record".[10] It is ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S.[11]

        The paper is owned by The New York Times Company, which is publicly traded. It has been governed by the Sulzberger family since 1896, through a dual-class share structure after its shares became publicly traded.[12] A. G. Sulzberger and his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.—the paper's publisher and the company's chairman, respectively—are the fifth and fourth generation of the family to head the paper.[13]
        
        Since the mid-1970s, The New York Times has expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. Since 2008,[14] the Times has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features.[15] On Sundays, the Times is supplemented by the Sunday Review (formerly the Week in Review),[16] The New York Times Book Review,[17] The New York Times Magazine,[18] and T: The New York Times Style Magazine.[19]</p>
